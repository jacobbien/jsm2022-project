#' A package to help you decide what talks to attend at JSM
#'
#' We scraped the JSM program and wrangled decades of citation and coauthorship
#' data from Semantic Scholar and Arxiv.  We have also included functionality 
#' for exporting your schedule as an ical that can be loaded into Google 
#' Calendar or similar. The result is a package that streamlines the
#' process of finding talks that you may want to attend.
