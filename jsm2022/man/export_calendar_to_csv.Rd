\title{Export events to a .csv format that can be imported to Google Calendar}
\usage{
export_calendar_to_csv(schedule, file = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{schedule}{output of a call to \code{get_talks()}}

\item{file}{filename of .csv that will be created}
}
\description{
This will create a .csv file that can then be imported into Google Calendar.
To do so, go to https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/settings/export
and then click "Select file from your computer", and find the file created by
this function. Then choose which calendar you want these events added to and
click "Import."  The disadvantage of this approach is that the times (which are
ET) will be entered in the local time of your calendar.  So if your calendar is
in a different time zone when you enter these, the events will be at the wrong
time.  Using \code{export_calendar_to_ics()} does not have this problem so is the
recommended function to use rather than this one.
