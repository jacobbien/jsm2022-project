\title{A package to help you decide what talks to attend at JSM}
\description{
We scraped the JSM program and wrangled decades of citation and coauthorship
data from Semantic Scholar and Arxiv.  We have also included functionality
for exporting your schedule as an ical that can be loaded into Google
Calendar or similar. The result is a package that streamlines the
process of finding talks that you may want to attend.
